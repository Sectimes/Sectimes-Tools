## Introduction:
This 'Webtool' is mainly built for easing your pentesting work by intergrating many tools together (`nmap`, `ffuf`, `gobuster`,...), which could help you not to install lots of your tools on your local computer.

## Requirements:
- PHP 7.4+
- Nginx
- Laravel
- Composer
- Docker (Optional)

## Installation:
### Manually Build 
- Clone the project:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:Sectimes/Sectimes-Tools.git
```
- Build the project:
```bash
cd Sectimes-Tools && php artisan serve
```
- By default, the project should be built on port 8000.
- Go to `http://localhost:8000` to connect to the app.

### Build with Docker:
(Note that the PHP version we are using in Docker is 7.4.33)
- First, clone the project:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:Sectimes/Sectimes-Tools.git
```
- Get into the folder and build the project:
```bash
cd Sectimes-Tools && docker-compose up
```
- If things run smoothly, by default, the project would comes up on port 8000.
- Go to `http://localhost:8000` to connect to the app.
